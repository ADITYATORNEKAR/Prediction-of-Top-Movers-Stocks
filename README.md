# Prediction-of-Top-Movers-Stocks

Project name: Prediction of Top Movers (% change) stocks using Market sentiment scores and Yahoo Finance data (RNN-LSTM architecture)

Description: 
People who are able to predict the future are often compared with god, as no
common entity can predict the future correctly on a regular basis. Predicting the future
correctly for financial gains can make a person get everything from nothing. As per
Arthur Clarke’s third law, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable
from magic” [1]. Using complex machine learning algorithms and Artificial Neural
Networks, we can not only mimic the human brain, but also achieve what a human
brain could never do humanly i.e. predict the stock prices and more importantly
predicting Top Movers stock for maximum financial gains, which is nothing less than
magic. To support this idea, RNN architecture LSTM models are used in combination
with the market sentiment information and stock market quantitative data to
understand the effect and further categorize stocks dynamically into whether the stock
will be a Top Mover;with good enough percentage change in stock value from the
previous day or will the stock perform in a regular manner.

Installation: 
The repository consists of Python Code used for analysis and web scrapping of financial market news along with hyper-parameter tuned Recurrent Neural Netowrks - LSTM models used for stock price prediction usign Yahoo Finance stock market data and market sentiment scores.
